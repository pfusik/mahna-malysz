Mahna-Małysz
============

This is a game for
[8-bit Atari computers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family).
You control the famous ski jumper
[Adam Małysz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Ma%C5%82ysz)
using one button.

Requirements
------------

* Atari 400 or 800 or any model from XL/XE series
* a joystick with a fire button, or you can use a Shift key on your computer
* color screen recommended
* beer and friends (optional)

If you have no real Atari computer, use an emulator:
[Atari800Win PLus](http://www.atari.org.pl/PLus/index_us.htm),
[Altirra](http://www.virtualdub.org/altirra.html)
or [Atari800](http://atari800.sourceforge.net/).
You will need to configure ROM images (separate download)
and joysticks (which can be mapped to any PC keys).
In emulators, the Start/Select/Option keys are usually mapped to F2, F3 and F4.

History
-------

This game was written in 2003 when Adam was a very successful ski jumper.
The game is less than 4 kilobyte long.
It took ninth place in MiniGame Compo 2003.

In 2016 the game was enhanced with submitting the scores to the internet.

Gameplay
--------

Adam was not only the world champion, but also won the World Cup several times.
How did he do such amazing things? There are different theories.
The fact is that one of Adam's sponsors was the manufacturer
of a popular energy drink ("Gives you wings!").
It is also widely known that before jumping Adam ate a bread roll with a banana
(if you think that's amazing, you ought to see his jumps).

To my knowledge, rules of ski jumps don't forbid use of arms in order to fly
a little farther. Use fire button to flap Adam's arms. Or use a Shift key.
Or (if you own an [Atari XEGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_XEGS)
and can't find your keyboard nor joystick) use Start.
Avoid other ski jumpers, birds etc.
You must collect your "fuel" (only drinks and bananas, as Adam has already
eaten sufficient amount of bread rolls).
After each kilometer the tailwind gets stronger, up to 8 kilometers
(such distance is a challenge even for Adam).
