Requirements
------------

* Atari 400 or 800 computer, or any model from the XL/XE series
* a joystick with a fire button, or you can use a Shift key on your computer
* color screen (recommended)
* beer and friends (recommended)

If you have no real Atari computer, use an emulator:
[Atari800Win PLus](http://www.atari.org.pl/PLus/index_us.htm),
[Altirra](https://www.virtualdub.org/altirra.html)
or [Atari800](https://atari800.github.io).
You will need to configure ROM images (separate download)
and joysticks (which can be mapped to any PC keys).
In emulators, the Start/Select/Option keys are usually mapped to F2, F3 and F4.

History
-------

This game was written in 2003 when Adam was a very successful ski jumper.
The whole game is shorter than 4 kilobytes.
It took ninth place in [MiniGame Compo 2003](https://web.archive.org/web/20080512084442/http://starbase.globalpc.net/minigame/index.results.html).

In 2016, the game was enhanced with submitting scores to the internet.

Gameplay
--------

Adam was not only the world champion, but also won the World Cup several times.
How did he achieve such amazing things? There are different theories.
The fact is that one of Adam's sponsors was the manufacturer
of a popular energy drink ("Gives You Wings!").
It is also widely known that before jumping, Adam was eating a bread roll
with a banana. (if you thank THAT was incredible, wait until you see his jumps)

To my knowledge, rules of ski jumps don't forbid the use of arms in order to fly
a little farther. Use the fire button to flap Adam's arms. Or use a Shift key.
In case you own an [Atari XEGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_XEGS)
and lost your keyboard and joystick, use Start.
Avoid other ski jumpers, birds etc.
You must collect your "fuel" (only drinks and bananas, as Adam has already
eaten sufficient amount of bread rolls).
After each kilometer the tailwind gets stronger, up to 8 kilometers
(which is a distance that poses a challenge even for Adam).
